Statement of Purpose: Alex Chen
Applicant for Ph.D. in Computer Science

The intricate dance between theoretical models and real-world phenomena has always been the driving force behind my academic pursuits. From my early fascination with building a rule-based chatbot in high school to my undergraduate research in Natural Language Processing (NLP), I have been captivated by the power of computer science to solve complex problems and reshape our understanding of the world. It is this passion that leads me to apply for the Ph.D. in Computer Science at Harvard University, a place where intellectual boundaries are constantly pushed and groundbreaking research is a tradition.

My academic journey at the University of California, Berkeley, provided me with a robust foundation in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. Courses such as CS 188 (Artificial Intelligence) and CS 288 (Natural Language Processing) not only solidified my theoretical knowledge but also challenged me to think critically and creatively. However, it was my research experience under the guidance of Professor Dan Klein that truly defined my academic trajectory. In our work on developing a model for detecting and mitigating bias in large language models, I was responsible for implementing a novel attention mechanism to identify and flag potentially biased token generation in real-time. This project culminated in a co-authored paper submitted to the ACL 2025 conference, and more importantly, it honed my skills in PyTorch, transformer architectures, and statistical analysis, solidifying my interest in Ethical AI and Interpretable NLP. This experience taught me the value of perseverance in the face of complex challenges and the profound satisfaction of contributing a new piece to the puzzle of human knowledge.

The primary reason I am drawn to Harvard's John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) is its unparalleled faculty and pioneering research in interpretable machine learning. I am particularly inspired by the work of Professor Alexander Rush. Their research on structured prediction and efficient deep learning models for NLP deeply resonates with my own interests in creating more transparent AI systems. I believe my experience in developing custom attention mechanisms could allow me to contribute meaningfully to their lab's work on building more efficient transformers. Furthermore, I am eager to learn from Professor Finale Doshi-Velez, whose work in interpretable machine learning and its application in healthcare could provide a complementary perspective to my proposed research. The opportunity to collaborate with and learn from such distinguished scholars would be invaluable.

Beyond the faculty, Harvardâ€™s resources, such as The Institute for Applied Computational Science (IACS), present an unparalleled environment for my academic growth. I am confident that access to these facilities will be instrumental in pursuing my proposed research topic: creating interpretable frameworks for large-scale language models to ensure fairness and transparency. I envision my doctoral research exploring the development of a new set of metrics for model interpretability and applying them to models used in sensitive domains like law and medicine.

Upon completing my Ph.D., my goal is to become a professor at a leading research university. I aim to tackle the "black box" problem in AI, which hinders trust and adoption, and mentor the next generation of researchers dedicated to building safe and beneficial artificial intelligence. A Harvard education, with its rigorous training, interdisciplinary approach, and vibrant intellectual community, is the most critical step in achieving these aspirations. I am not just seeking a degree; I am seeking an intellectual home where I can be challenged, inspired, and empowered to make a lasting contribution to my field.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager for the opportunity to contribute to and learn from the distinguished academic community at Harvard University.
